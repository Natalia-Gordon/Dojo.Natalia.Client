# Quick Start Guide - Creating Audio File

## Option 1: Record Dani Waxman's Voice (Recommended)

Ask Dani Waxman to record the article himself. Use:
- Smartphone voice recorder app
- Audacity (free, supports MP3 export)
- Save as: `zen-today-dani-waxman.mp3` in `src/assets/audio/`

   - **Free:** https://ttsforge.com/language/he-IL

4. Paste the text
5. Select a Hebrew male voice
6. Download as MP3
7. Rename to: `zen-today-dani-waxman.mp3`
8. Place in: `src/assets/audio/`

### Free TTS Options:
